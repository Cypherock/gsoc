## Reporting a Vulnerability

We value security for the project very highly. We encourage all users to report any vulnerabilities they discover to us.
If you find a security vulnerability in any of the Cypherock project, please report it responsibly by sending an email to support@cypherock.com

We also a have a bug bounty program, where you can report the bugs and vulnerabilities, so that we can continue building a secure application for the entire community. You can participate in the bug bounty program at - https://www.cypherock.com/bug-bounty
